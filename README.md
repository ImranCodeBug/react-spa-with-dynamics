# React-SPA-with-Dynamics 365

Welcome to my tutorial of using Adal JS to connect to Dynamics 365 via app registration. The explanation for the code can be found on [my blog](https://imran-chowdhury.blogspot.com/2019/10/using-adal-js-to-achieve-single-signon.html). A big thanks to [Mark Findlater](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mark-findlater-1428a01/) for reviewing the blog.
